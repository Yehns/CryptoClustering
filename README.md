# CryptoClustering
Module 19

The homework assignment will focus on analyzing the price changes of cryptocurrencies within both a 7-hour and 24-hour timeframe. This will involve using PCA tables to observe trends, jumps, clusters, and outliers, as well as creating variance arrays to determine how far values deviate from the mean.
